Q1. Which two operator overloading methods can you use in your classes to support iteration?
 
Addition , logical operators

Q2. In what contexts do the two operator overloading methods manage printing?

Q3. In a class, how do you intercept slice operations?
 the slice() returns a slice object

Q4. In a class, how do you capture in-place addition?

Python provides the operator x += y to add two objects in-place by calculating the sum x + y 
and assigning the result to the first operands variable name x

Q5. When is it appropriate to use operator overloading?

When one or both operands are of a user-defined class or structure type
operator overloading makes it easier to specify user-defined implementation for such operations.
This makes user-defined types more similar to the basic primitive data types in terms of behaviour.
