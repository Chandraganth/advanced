Q1. What is the concept of a metaclass?
        
        Metaclass in Python is a class of a class that defines how a class behaves.
        A class is itself a instance of Metaclass and any Instance of Class in Python is an Instance of type metaclass.
        E.g. Type of of int, str, float, list, tuple and many more is of metaclass type.

Q2. What is the best way to declare a class's metaclass?

A way to declare a classâ€™ metaclass is by using metaclass keyword in class definition.

Q3. How do class decorators overlap with metaclasses for handling classes ?
     
     Anything we can do with a class decorator we can  do with a custom metaclasses (just apply the functionality of the "decorator function", i.e., the one that takes a class object and modifies it, in the course of the metaclass's __new__ or __init__ that make the class object!).

Q4. How do class decorators overlap with metaclasses for handling instances?
  
  Decorators essentially automate the prior example's manual name rebinding 
  Just like with metaclasses, because the decorator returns the original class, instances are made from it, not from a wrapper object.
  In fact instance creation is not intercepted at all.
