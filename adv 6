Describe three applications for exception processing.

        try , except , finally and raise to raise  exception
        
        try: if there is a code that may raise an exception, it can placed in try block
        except: after try we should include except statement followed by code
                 it can have single as well as multiple exceptions
                 
Q2. What happens if you don't do something extra to treat an exception
      
      when we don't handle when a exception is occurred ,the program terminates abruptly
      and the code past the line that caused the exception will not be executed

Q3. What are your options for recovering from an exception in your script?
            
            by using the code inside the try block

Q4. Describe two methods for triggering exceptions in your script.
  by raise keyword we can raise an exception like any exception eg: division by zero

Q5. Identify two methods for specifying actions to be executed at termination time, regardless of
whether or not an exception exists.
                      
                      the code will be executed statement by statement, if no exception occurs
                      the execution will reach the break statement and the loop will be left
